"""
Computes market-welfare metrics by country from a solved PyPSA network.

Welfare is decomposed as:
  - producer surplus per generator: (price_at_bus - marginal_cost) * dispatch
  - producer surplus per storage unit: (price_at_bus * dispatch) -
    (marginal_cost * discharge), i.e. charging is only "paid for" via the
    price term (dispatch is negative while charging), discharge cost only
    applies to the positive (discharging) part of dispatch
  - consumer surplus per load: (VOLL - price_at_bus) * demand
  - congestion rent per line: (price_bus1 - price_bus0) * flow, split
    50/50 between the two connected countries
  - congestion rent per link (e.g. HVDC interconnectors): revenue from
    power delivered at bus1 minus cost of power withdrawn at bus0
    (accounts for link efficiency losses), split 50/50 between the two
    connected countries

Consumer surplus needs a value-of-lost-load (VOLL) assumption because
demand in PyPSA is usually modelled as fixed/inelastic (p_set), so there's
no explicit willingness-to-pay curve to integrate. If your model has
elastic demand or bids, replace consumer_surplus_by_country() accordingly.

All of this requires nodal marginal prices (network.buses_t.marginal_price),
so the network must already be solved before calling these functions.
